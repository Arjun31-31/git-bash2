        <h2>What is COVID-19?</h2>
        <p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.

            Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.
            
            The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face. 
            
            The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so it’s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).</p>

            <h2>Origin</h2>
            <p>COVID-19's causative virus, SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), was isolated in late 2019.[57] Its genetic sequence was published on 11 January 2020, triggering an urgent international response to prepare for an outbreak and hasten development of a preventive COVID-19 vaccine.[58][59][60] Since early 2020, vaccine development has been expedited via unprecedented collaboration in the multinational pharmaceutical industry and between governments.[61] By June 2020, tens of billions of dollars were invested by corporations, governments, international health organizations, and university research groups to develop dozens of vaccine candidates and prepare for global vaccination programs to immunize against COVID‑19 infection</p>

            <h2>Vaccine</h2>
            <p>As of January 2021, nine different technology platforms – with the technology of numerous candidates remaining undefined[clarification needed] – are under research and development to create an effective vaccine against COVID‑19.[3][27] Most of the platforms of vaccine candidates in clinical trials are focused on the coronavirus spike protein and its variants as the primary antigen of COVID‑19 infection.[27] Platforms being developed in 2020 involved nucleic acid technologies (nucleoside-modified messenger RNA and DNA), non-replicating viral vectors, peptides, recombinant proteins, live attenuated viruses, and inactivated viruses.[14][27][33][34]</p>
